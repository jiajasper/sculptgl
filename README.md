What is this
======

This is a fork of SculptGL as an UX study and experiment with AI features.
The intention is to have a free 3D sculpting tool on the web that is very intuitive while providing superpower with paid AI features such as text to 3D, image to 3D, text to HDRI and texture generation (seperate tool at beta.ideate.xyz)
